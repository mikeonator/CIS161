0x156C                  Load register 0x5 with the bit pattern found in the memory cell at address 0x6C.
0x166D                  Load register 0x6 with the bit pattern found in the memory cell at address 0x6D.
0x5056                  Add the contents of register 0x5 and 0x6 as though they were two’s complement representation and leave the result in register 0x0.
0x306E                  Store the contents of register 0x0 in the memory cell at address 0x6E.
0xC000                  Halt.

The following are instructions written in Vole machine language. Rewrite them in English.

    0x368A
        STORE the bit pattern found in register 0x6 in the memory cell whose address is 0x8A
    0xBADE
        JUMP to the instruction located in the memory cell at address DE if the bit pattern in register 0xA is equal to the bit pattern in register 0x0. Otherwise, continue with the normal sequence of execution.
    0x803C
        AND the bit patterns in register 0x3 and 0xC and place the result in register 0x0
    0x40F4
        MOVE the bit pattern found in register 0xF to register 0x4

Here are some instructions in English. Translate each of them into Vole machine language.
LOAD register number 0x3 with the value stored at location hexadecimal value 0x56.
ROTATE register number 0x5 three bits to the right.
AND the contents of register 0xA with the contents of register 0x5 and leave the result in register 0x0.
