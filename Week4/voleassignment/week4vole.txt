0x156C                  Load register 0x5 with the bit pattern found in the memory cell at address 0x6C.
0x166D                  Load register 0x6 with the bit pattern found in the memory cell at address 0x6D.
0x5056                  Add the contents of register 0x5 and 0x6 as though they were two’s complement representation and leave the result in register 0x0.

The following are instructions written in Vole machine language. Rewrite them in English.

    0x368A
        STORE the bit pattern found in register 0x6 in the memory cell whose address is 0x8A
    0xBADE
        JUMP to the instruction located in the memory cell at address DE if the bit pattern in register 0xA is equal to the bit pattern in register 0x0. Otherwise, continue with the normal sequence of execution.
    0x803C
        AND the bit patterns in register 0x3 and 0xC and place the result in register 0x0
    0x40F4
        MOVE the bit pattern found in register 0xF to register 0x4

Here are some instructions in English. Translate each of them into Vole machine language.
    LOAD register number 0x3 with the value stored at location hexadecimal value 0x56.
        0x1356
    ROTATE register number 0x5 three bits to the right.
        0xA503
    AND the contents of register 0xA with the contents of register 0x5 and leave the result in register 0x0.
        0x80A5

Suppose the Vole memory cells from addresses 0x00 to 0x05 contain the bit patterns given in the following table:


Address Contents
0x00    0x14
0x01    0x02
0x02    0x34
0x03    0x17
0x04    0xC0
0x05    0x00

If we start the machine with its program counter containing 0x00, what bit pattern is in the memory cell whose address is 0x17 when the machine halts?

    Step 1 - 0x1402 - Load the register 0x4 with the bit pattern found in the memory cell whose address is 0x02
        register 0x4 = 0x34
    
    Step 2 - 0x3417 - Store the bit pattern found in register 0x4 into the memory cell whose address is 0x17
        memory address 0x17 = 0x34
    
    Step 3 - 0xC000 - Halt

    The bit pattern 0x34 is in memory cell whose address is 0x17

Perform the indicated operations.

        00001011
    AND 10101011
    =   00001011

        01001011
    OR  10101011
    =   11101011

        01001011
    XOR 11101100
    =   10100111
